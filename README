Quick REAMDME. 

1. Use CyanogenMod ICS (9.1.0) as base. For this to work, you need to have basic skills in building CM ROM's already. 

2. Download original kernel for the HTC Desire SV from htcdev.com

3. Source should build now...
cd ~/android/system		(goto root directory of CM)
source build/envsetup.sh	(sets build environment; e.g. this sets paths to "lunch" commands)
lunch cm_magnids-eng		(sets the build system for the device)
make clobber			(removes build directory to ensure completely fresh rebuild)
make -j12 recoveryimage		(builds recovery image by a 6-core host)
